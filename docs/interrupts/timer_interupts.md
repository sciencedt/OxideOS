## Timer Interrupts - Brief Overview
Timer interrupts are the heartbeat of an operating system. Here's what they do:
Core Functions:

Preemptive Multitasking - Forces the OS to regain control from running programs so it can switch to other tasks (prevents programs from hogging the CPU)
Process Scheduling - Triggers the scheduler to decide which process should run next (round-robin, priority-based, etc.)
Timekeeping - Maintains system clock, timestamps, and elapsed time tracking
Sleep/Delay Functions - Enables sleep(), timeouts, and timed operations
Periodic Tasks - Triggers housekeeping like memory cleanup, disk syncing, network timeouts

## Why Critical:
Without timer interrupts, a cooperative system requires programs to voluntarily give up CPU control. One misbehaving program could freeze the entire system.
With timer interrupts, you have a preemptive system where the OS forcibly takes control at regular intervals (typically 18-1000 times per second), ensuring system responsiveness and fair CPU sharing.
Think of it as: The OS setting an alarm clock that rings constantly, reminding it to check on all running programs and make sure everything is fair and responsive.
In your kernel, once timer interrupts work properly, you can implement multitasking, process scheduling, and time-based system calls!
